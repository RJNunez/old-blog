Trying MD File

# Does this work?

Hey you, I want to check if creating an md file locally and then
updating it to the repo will properly convert. Here Iâ€™m plotting the
distribution of points for the three players in the regular season.

``` r
set.seed(5)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)

ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x, y), alpha = 0.50) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y), pch = 1)
```

Now, this is the distribution of points but during the playoff. Again,
considering all three players:

``` r
set.seed(5)
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- rnorm(1000)

ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x, y), alpha = 0.50) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y), pch = 1)
```
