My name is Rolando J. Acosta Nunez and I'm from Carolina, Puerto Rico. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computational Mathematics from the University of Puerto Rico - Humacao, and currently I'm a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at Harvard University. The purpose of this blog is to, among other things, show the utility of statistics to a broad audience through fun examples. I will be leveraging ideas from sports, politics, art, philosophy, science, and other things. If you want to see an application of statistics to a specific context, feel free to contact me.
